B. Biology: Sustainable Ecosystems (Unit 1)

B1. Relating Science to Technology, Society, and the Environment
By the end of this course, students will:

B1.1 assess, on the basis of research, the impact of a factor related to human activity (e.g., urban sprawl, introduction of invasive species, overhunting/overfishing) that threatens the sustainability of a terrestrial or aquatic ecosystem [IP, PR, AI, C]
Sample issue: The Great Lakes constitute an important shipping route. Foreign ships often empty their ballast water, which can contain invasive species, directly into the lakes. The goby, which was likely imported in ballast water,
is an aggressive fish that has taken over the spawning grounds of some native species, threatening the balance of the ecosystem.
Sample questions: How has suburban development on the Niagara Escarpment or the Oak Ridges Moraine affected local ecosystems? How has the zebra mussel population in Lake Erie affected aquatic species and water quality? How
has commercial logging affected the sustainability of forests in Northern Ontario?
B1.2 evaluate the effectiveness of government initiatives in Canada (federal, provincial, municipal), and/or the efforts of societal groups or non-governmental organizations, such as Aboriginal communities, environmental groups, or student organizations, with respect to an environmental issue that affects the sustainability of terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems (e.g., wetland restoration, recycling programs, Canada–Ontario Environmental Farm Plans, stewardship of national and provincial parks) [AI, C]
Sample issue: Landfill sites can have negative effects on adjacent ecosystems, attracting pests, leaching toxic chemicals, and producing greenhouse gases. Municipal recycling and composting programs divert garbage, reducing the need for new landfill sites. However, many people, particularly rural residents and those in apartment buildings, may not be included in these programs.
Sample questions: What provincial or federal legislation attempts to protect special features or sensitive elements of terrestrial or freshwater ecosystems? How could such legislation be more effective? How have the actions of local
wetland-reclamation, municipal tree-planting, Aboriginal fisheries-management, Great Lakes rehabilitation, organic farming, or other groups helped to ensure ecological sustainability? What further action could such groups take?

B2. Developing Skills of Investigation and Communication
By the end of this course, students will:

B2.3 plan and conduct an investigation, involving both inquiry and research, into how a human activity affects soil composition or soil fertility (e.g., changes to soil composition resulting from the use of different compostable materials, organic or inorganic fertilizers, or pesticides), and, extrapolating from the data and information gathered, explain the impact of this activity on the sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems
[IP, PR, AI, C]
B2.4 plan and conduct an investigation, involving both inquiry and research, into how a human activity affects water quality (e.g., leaching of organic or inorganic fertilizers or pesticides into water systems, changes to watersheds resulting
from deforestation or land development, diversion of ground water for industrial uses), and, extrapolating from the data and information gathered, explain the impact of this activity on the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems [IP, PR, AI, C]
B2.5 analyse the effect of human activity on the populations of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems by interpreting data and generating graphs (e.g., data from Statistics Canada, Parks Canada, and other websites on: the concentration in water of chemicals from fertilizer run-off and their effect on the growth of algae; stressors associated with human use of natural areas, such as trampled vegetation, wildlife mortality from motor vehicles, and the removal of plants, animals, and/or natural objects; suburban developments and their impact on the food supply for animals such as foxes and racoons) [PR, AI, C]

By the end of this course, students will:

B3.1 compare and contrast biotic and abiotic characteristics of sustainable and unsustainable
terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems
B3.2 describe the complementary processes of cellular respiration and photosynthesis with respect to the flow of energy and the cycling of matter within ecosystems (i.e., carbon dioxide is a by-product of cellular respiration and is used for photosynthesis, which produces oxygen needed for cellular respiration), and explain how human activities can disrupt the
balance achieved by these processes (e.g., automobile use increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; planting more trees decreases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere)
B3.3 describe the limiting factors of ecosystems (e.g., nutrients, space, water, energy, predators), and explain how these factors affect the carrying capacity of an ecosystem (e.g., the effect of an increase in the moose population on the wolf population in the same ecosystem)
B3.4 identify the earth’s four spheres (biosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere), and describe the relationship that must exist between these spheres if diversity and sustainability are to be maintained
B3.5 identify various factors related to human activity that have an impact on ecosystems (e.g., the introduction of invasive species; shoreline development; industrial emissions that result in acid rain), and explain how these factors affect
the equilibrium and survival of ecosystems (e.g., invasive species push out native species and upset the equilibrium in an ecosystem; shoreline development affects the types of terrestrial and aquatic life that can live near lake shores or river banks; acid rain changes the pH of water, which affects the type of aquatic life that can survive in a lake)

How do the chemical properties of peroxide make it suitable for use in hair dye? What are the hazards associated with this use?
C1.2 assess social, environmental, and economic impacts of the use of common elements or compounds [AI, C]
Sample issue: By reducing the accumulation of ice on roads, road salt makes winter driving safer, decreasing medical and insurance costs associated with motor vehicle accidents. But the compounds in road salt damage roads and vehicles, pollute water systems, and harm animals and vegetation.
Sample questions: How has the presence of mercury in water bodies in Northern Ontario affected the environment and the lives of Aboriginal people?

Sample issue: Replacing incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs can reduce the energy needed to light a home by 75%. Although the bulbs are more expensive than incandescent bulbs, electrical companies sometimes provide
coupons to reduce the price. Also, the Ontario government is phasing out incandescent bulbs, which will further reduce energy consumption.
Sample questions: What are EnerGuide and ENERGY STAR, and how can they be used when purchasing appliances or electronics? What is the difference in energy consumption between a conventional and a front-loading washing machine? What appliances consume electrical energy even when they are not in use?

B1.1 analyse, on the basis of research, ethical issues related to a technological development in the field of systems biology (e.g., cloning, stem-cell research, live organ transplants, transgenic transplants), and communicate their findings [IP, PR, AI, C]
Sample issue: DNA screening is a valuable tool for determining whether a person is genetically predisposed to certain diseases. However, it raises ethical issues related to privacy, choice, access, treatment, and discrimination. It also raises questions about how far society should go in using available technologies, who funds research, and who owns or manages the resulting product or technology.
Sample questions: What are the ethical arguments for and against stem-cell research? What ethical issues might arise when a drug company funds trials of a new drug it has developed to treat a genetic disorder? Who should determine how the results of transgenic research in plants and animals will be applied?

Sample issue: Ultrasound is routinely used during pregnancy to monitor the development of the fetus. It is also used to perform amniocentesis, which screens for genetic disorders, and allows doctors to perform surgery on the fetus before birth to correct some abnormalities. However, there have been few studies on the long-term effects of the use of ultrasound.
Sample questions: How are medical imaging technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease and stroke? What types of imaging technologies are used in ophthalmology? How have they benefited people who have eye disease? How have developments in biophotonics advanced a range of surgical procedures?

Sample issue: Early-childhood vaccination programs have greatly reduced the incidence of certain diseases and the social and medical costs associated with them. Influenced by controversial studies arguing that there may be health risks associated with such vaccines, some parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children, which could lead to a resurgence of these potentially deadly diseases.
Sample questions: What strategies are included in public health initiatives aimed at reducing the incidence of smoking-related diseases? What impact have these initiatives had on smoking rates and associated medical costs? How have health authorities responded to the threat of West Nile virus? What effect does this response have on people’s lifestyles? How did various cultures attempt to prevent disease before vaccines were available? What impact have vaccines had on global health?

Sample issue: Ammonia and chlorine bleach are two common household cleaning agents. However, when these two substances are mixed, the chemical reaction produces chlorine gas, which is highly toxic.
Sample questions: Why is it important to understand the chemical composition of chlorinating agents used in swimming pools before using them? What chemical reactions result in acid precipitation? What impact does it have on the environment? What sources of information are available on the safety or environmental implications of chemicals and chemical reactions? Why is it important to ensure that these sources are up to date? Why is it important to understand WHMIS information, including Material Safety Data Sheets, before using any chemicals?
C1.2 analyse how an understanding of the properties of chemical substances and their reactions can be applied to solve environmental challenges (e.g., renewing the Great Lakes, neutralizing acid spills, scrubbing smokestack emissions) [AI, C]
Sample issue: Spills from oil tankers damage the environment by contaminating water and shorelines, killing birds and aquatic life. Biological oil agents help break down the oil so it degrades faster and does less damage to the environment.
Sample questions: How does the addition of lime reduce the acidification of water? How can this reaction be applied to renew lakes that have been affected by acid precipitation? Why is acid leaching used in soil contaminated with heavy metals?

D1. Relating Science to Technology, Society, and the Environment
By the end of this course, students will:

d1.1 analyse current and/or potential effects, both positive and negative, of climate change on human activity and natural systems (e.g., loss of habitat for Arctic mammals such as polar bears and loss of traditional lifestyles for Inuit as Arctic
ice shrinks; famine as arable land is lost to desertification; an increase in water-borne disease and human resettlement as coastal lands are flooded; expansion of the growing season in some regions) [AI, C]
Sample issue: Scientists are researching changes in climate patterns as possible contributing factors to an increase in the number of smog days in Ontario and elsewhere in Canada. As the air quality worsens, people may curtail their outdoor activities, and those with respiratory problems may require medical attention, increasing health care costs.
Sample questions: How have recent extreme weather events such as heat waves in Europe or drought in southern Africa affected habitats in these regions? How might predicted changes to global temperature and precipitation affect agri-
culture in Ontario, Canada, or different areas around the world? How might the continuing reduction of the polar ice cap influence domestic and international transportation and shipping?

course of action related to one of these initiatives [PR, AI, C]
Sample issue: Governments and industry have created rebates or tax cuts to encourage consumers to replace their old appliances with efficient ENERGY STAR appliances. However, such initiatives do not take into account the resources
used to create the new products or the problems associated with the disposal of old appliances.
Sample questions: What type of recycling and composting programs are in place in your community? What proportion of locally generated garbage do they divert from landfill sites? How could they be improved? What is the purpose of carbon offset credits? Do they achieve that purpose? Why or why not?

d2.4 investigate a popular hypothesis on a cause-and-effect relationship having to do with climate change (e.g., the combustion of fossil fuels is re- sponsible for rising global temperatures; the concentration of atmospheric CO2 is responsible for rising global temperatures; global temperatures have been on the increase since the industrial revolution; the severity of cyclones, hurricanes, and tornadoes increases as atmospheric temperatures increase), using simulations
and/or time-trend data that model climate profiles (e.g., data from Statistics Canada and Environment Canada) [PR, AI, C]
d2.5 investigate, through laboratory inquiry or simulations, the effects of heat transfer within the hydrosphere and atmosphere [PR, AI]

Yet, coal power is inefficient, and
the mining and burning of coal produce a great deal of pollution. Although technology is available to make coal cleaner, it is costly and has been implemented to only a limited extent.

B. Diversity of Living Things (Unit 1)

B1. Relating Science to Technology, Society, and the Environment (Unit 1)
By the end of this course, students will:

B1.1 analyse some of the risks and benefits of human intervention (e.g., tree plantations; monoculture of livestock or agricultural crops; overharvesting of wild plants for medicinal purposes; using pesticides to control pests; suppression of wild fires) to the biodiversity of aquatic or terrestrial ecosystems [AI, C]
Sample issue: Stocking lakes with fish provides recreation for fishing enthusiasts and increases the amount of food available for humans and other animals. However, this practice also increases the competition for food, which could threaten native species and affect the natural biodiversity of the aquatic ecosystem.
Sample questions: What types of conservation efforts have been made to help protect local wetlands from urban developments? In what ways does the planting of native species in a disturbed area help to improve the ecosystem?
How and why might some species benefit from human intervention?
B1.2 analyse the impact that climate change might have on the diversity of living things (e.g., rising temperatures can result in habitat loss or expansion; changing rainfall levels can cause drought or flooding of habitats) [AI, C]
Sample issue: Some scientists believe that we are in the early stages of a human-made mass extinction partly caused by rapid climate change. Many species that cannot tolerate the change will become extinct. However, Earth’s history has shown that extinction of some species creates opportunities for surviving species to adapt, evolve, and flourish.
Sample questions: Why do higher temperatures affect the survival of some species in freshwater environments? Why would an increase in ocean temperatures endanger many species that depend on coral as a home and food supply? In what ways have longer growing seasons, which may include a second harvest, affected the biodiversity of agricultural lands? How might species such as the Eastern Massasauga rattle- snake be affected by increased water levels in their habitats?

C1. Relating Science to Technology, Society, and the Environment
By the end of this course, students will:

c1.1 analyse, on the basis of research, the economic and environmental advantages and disadvantages of an artificial selection technology (e.g., livestock and horticultural breeding) [IP, PR, AI, C]
Sample issue: Selective breeding of agricultural crops can benefit populations in less-developed countries by producing hardier crops, increasing food supplies, and improving the nutritional content of food. However, opponents of artificial
selection technology believe that it affects the natural ability of a species to reproduce, which negatively affects biodiversity.
Sample questions: How has selective breeding of specific crops helped to increase the yield of the crop and decrease the need for chemicals in the fields? How has the introduction of genetically engineered species in the horticultural
industry affected other species planted in the same areas? In what ways do the characteristics of today’s farm animals, such as cattle, pigs, and chickens, differ from those of earlier farm animals? What are the reasons for the differences?
c1.2 evaluate the possible impact of an environmental change on natural selection and on the vulnerability of species (e.g., adaptation to environmental changes can affect reproductive success of an organism) [AI, C]
Sample issue: An increase in forest fires in some areas of North America has affected the repro- ductive success of some species as their food supplies decrease and they are forced to adapt to adverse habitat conditions. Yet, forest fires also naturally promote changes in plant and animal species over time as the environment becomes more suitable for other species. Sample questions: Why has a decline in the milkweed population, as a result of urbanization and pesticides, affected the migration of monarch butterflies? How has the introduction of bacteria and viruses in inland lakes affected the life cycle of carp? What impact has the loss of bamboo forests to urbanization had on the giant panda’s ability to breed and live?

C3. Understanding Basic Concepts
By the end of this course, students will:

c3.1 explain the fundamental theory of evolution, using the evolutionary mechanism of natural selection to illustrate the process of biological change over time
c3.2 explain the process of adaptation of individual organisms to their environment (e.g., some disease-causing bacteria in a bacterial population can survive exposure to antibiotics due to slight genetic variations from the rest of the population, which allows successful surviving bacteria to pass on antibiotic resistance to the next generation)
c3.3 define the concept of speciation, and explain the process by which new species are formed
c3.4 describe some evolutionary mechanisms (e.g., natural selection, artificial selection, sexual selection, genetic variation, genetic drift, biotechnology), and explain how they affect the evolutionary development and extinction of various species (e.g., Darwin’s finches, giraffes, pandas)

D. Genetic Processes (Unit 3)

D1. Relating Science to Technology, Society, and the Environment
By the end of this course, students will:

d1.1 analyse, on the basis of research, some of the social and ethical implications of research in genetics and genomics (e.g., genetic screening, gene therapy, in vitro fertilization) [IP, PR, AI, C]
Sample issue: Gene therapy is a promising treatment for some inherited disorders such as cystic fibrosis. However, the technique remains risky and unproven, and there are ethical questions associated with its use and related research.
Sample questions: What are the possible social benefits of applications of stem-cell research? What ethical issues does such research raise? Why is the prospect of using genetically engineered material in human subjects controversial? What are some of the ethical issues related to gene therapy?
d1.2 evaluate, on the basis of research, the importance of some recent contributions to knowledge, techniques, and technologies related to genetic processes (e.g., research into the cystic fibrosis gene; the use of safflowers to produce insulin for human use) [IP, PR, AI, C]
Sample issue: Cancer researchers use bioinformatics and computational biology to study different types of cancer in an attempt to lower the risk of people who have a genetic predisposition to the disease. A risk is that this information could also be used to deny insurance coverage or payment of claims.
Sample questions: How has the human genome project allowed genetic research to move from a wet science to a dry science? How has the study of the copy number alteration of genes, conducted at the Hospital for Sick Children, helped researchers to understand genetic susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders? How has genomic research increased our
understanding of human health and diseases?

d3.3 explain the concepts of genotype, phenotype, dominance, incomplete dominance, codominance, recessiveness, and sex linkage according to Mendelian laws of inheritance
d3.4 describe some genetic disorders caused by chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., non-disjunction of chromosomes during meiosis) or other genetic mutations in terms of chromosomes affected, physical effects, and treatments
d3.5 describe some reproductive technologies (e.g., cloning, artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, recombinant DNA), and explain how their use can increase the genetic diversity of a species (e.g., farm animals, crops)
 
E. Animals: Structure and Function (Unit 4)

E1. Relating Science to Technology, Society, and the Environment
By the end of this course, students will:

e1.1 evaluate the importance of various technologies, including Canadian contributions, to our understanding of internal body systems (e.g., endoscopes can be used to locate, diagnose, and surgically remove digestive system tumours; lasers can be used during surgery to destroy lung tumours; nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR] imaging can be used to diagnose
injuries and cardiovascular disorders, such as aneurysms) [AI, C]
Sample issue: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) are non-invasive imaging technologies that can produce three-dimensional views of organs, tissues, and bones, providing valuable information on internal body systems. The imaging equipment is expensive to buy, operate, and maintain, so it is usually available only in
large urban centres with high demand.
Sample questions: How has the development of the two-photon imaging microscope im- proved our ability to locate and analyse rare types of cancerous cells? How are nanotechnologies being used in non-invasive exploratory surgeries? What are the benefits of new computer software that allows doctors to view three-dimensional models of organs for surgery and radiation treatments?
e1.2 assess how societal needs (e.g., the need for healthy foods; the need to counteract the effects of sedentary lifestyles) lead to scientific and technological developments related to internal systems (e.g., advances in dietary products and fitness equipment; improved standards for transplanting organs) [AI, C]
Sample issue: Diabetes is becoming a more common medical condition in Canada as a result of increasingly sedentary lifestyles and an aging population. Until recently, people with diabetes had to monitor their blood sugar and self-administer insulin. For many people, this regimen is now being replaced with more convenient and reliable insulin pump therapy.
Sample questions: How has the need to develop safer and faster tests for diagnosing internal diseases led to the development of nanotechnologies? What types of products have resulted from society’s demand for multifunctional foods, such as low-calorie junk foods? What types of technologies have been developed in response to the shortage of organs available for transplant?

e2.3 use medical equipment (e.g., a stethoscope, a sphygmomanometer) to monitor the functional responses of the respiratory and circulatory systems to external stimuli (e.g., measure the change in breathing rate and heart rate after
exercise) [PR, AI]

E3. Understanding Basic Concepts
By the end of this course, students will:

e3.1 explain the anatomy of the respiratory system and the process of ventilation and gas exchange from the environment to the cell (e.g., the movement of oxygen from the atmosphere to the cell; the roles of ventilation, hemoglobin, and diffusion in gas exchange)
e3.2 explain the anatomy of the digestive system and the importance of digestion in providing nutrients needed for energy and growth (e.g., the body’s mechanical and chemical processes digest food, which provides the proteins needed to build muscle, and the fibre, water, vitamins, and minerals needed to regulate body processes)
e3.3 explain the anatomy of the circulatory system (e.g., blood components, blood vessels, the heart) and its function in transporting substances that are vital to health
e3.4 describe some disorders related to the respiratory, digestive, and circulatory systems (e.g., asthma, emphysema, ulcers, colitis, cardiac arrest, arteriosclerosis)

F1. Relating Science to Technology, Society, and the Environment
By the end of this course, students will:

f1.1 evaluate, on the basis of research, the importance of plants to the growth and development of Canadian society (e.g., as a source of food, pharmaceuticals, Aboriginal medicines, building materials, flood and erosion control; as a resource for recreation and ecotourism) [IP, PR, AI, C]
Sample issue: The agricultural sector holds great economic potential as demand increases for products such as biofuels, biochemicals, and biopharmaceuticals. Bioresources could also support our efforts to produce renewable energy, improve health, and minimize environmental impact. However, critics are concerned about the impact of bioresources on the availability of food crops and the price of food.
Sample questions: In what ways does the local food movement contribute to community development? How does the re-introduction of native plant species along river banks help to prevent land erosion? What plant species are considered important in sustaining Canada’s growth in the agricultural sector? How might the increasing demand for straw-bale housing materials support Canada’s agricultural sector and increase the sustainability of other natural resources?
f1.2 evaluate, on the basis of research, ways in which different societies or cultures have used plants to sustain human populations while supporting environmental sustainability (e.g., sustainable agricultural practices in developing countries such as crop rotation and seed saving; traditional Aboriginal corn production practices) [IP, PR, AI, C]
Sample issue: Aboriginal peoples living near Canada’s boreal forest rely on forest plants for food and medicine. Plants are harvested by traditional methods to maintain natural habitats and local biodiversity. However, these traditional practices are threatened as more areas are subject to development and commercial resource exploitation.
Sample questions: How are strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plants being used by small communities and traditional healers in some developing countries? What effect does the re-establishment of wetland plants in agricultural settings have on the natural balance of the ecosystem? How are plants being used to clean wastewater from fish farms so that the water can go back into local streams?

Sample issue: Health care professionals are expected to calculate dosages of prescription drugs accurately and safely. This requires precision in applying fractions, decimals, ratios, percentages, and metric conversions. Despite the care taken by health care professionals, improper medication use by patients accounts for about 30% of hospital emergency department visits.
Sample questions: Why is baking powder used in cake batter? What happens when too much or too little of that ingredient is used? Why might two people on the same drug regimen not necessarily take the same dosage to treat the
same illness? How are carbon dioxide emissions calculated and why are they monitored?
d1.2 assess, on the basis of research, the importance of quantitative accuracy in industrial chemical processes and the potential impact on the environment if quantitative accuracy is not observed [IP, PR, AI, C]
Sample issue: Errors in quantitative accuracy have played a role in many industrial chemical disasters worldwide. Failing to adjust the quantities of chemicals needed to produce different batch sizes of a product have created runaway reactions, resulting in huge explosions. Such industrial accidents can have devastating short- and long-term effects on the environment.
Sample questions: Why is it important to use the correct salt-sand mix on highways during winter storms? Why is it important to correctly measure the chemicals used in water treatment plants?

Sample issue: Golf courses use fertilizer and irrigation systems to sustain the vegetation. However, chemical substances, when combined with water, may run off and pollute local water systems.
Sample questions: What pollutants might be found in untreated wastewater from a chicken farm or a poultry-processing plant? How do leachates from old landfill sites enter our water system? How might they affect the water quality of local streams? What are some of the sources and effects of mercury in water systems? What impact might this contaminant
have on Aboriginal communities that depend on fishing as a source of food?
e1.2 analyse economic, social, and environmental issues related to the distribution, purification, or use of drinking water (e.g., the impact on the environment of the use of bottled water) [AI, C]
Sample issue: In developing countries, thousands of people, many of them children, die every year from drinking contaminated water. Many of these countries cannot afford to build water treatment plants. In North America, where safe water is generally available, we spend millions of dollars on bottled water, draining sources of fresh water and challenging waste-disposal systems.
Sample questions: What are the economic costs of building, maintaining, and monitoring water-purification plants? What are the social and environmental costs if these plants are not properly maintained and monitored? How effective are municipal wastewater treatment processes at removing pharmaceuticals such as hormones and antibiotics from our drinking water?

How might “eat local–buy local” initiatives help to reduce our carbon footprint? How effectively does the use of digital communications for business reduce our carbon footprint?
f1.2 assess air quality conditions for a given Canadian location, using Environment Canada’s Air Quality Health Index, and report on some Canadian initiatives to improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gases (e.g., Ontario’s Drive Clean program to control vehicle emissions) [AI, C]
Sample issue: Historically, mining and smelting polluted the air, land, and water around Sudbury, Ontario. More recently, as a result of government regulations, industry has significantly reduced emissions, leading to an improvement in air
quality and reversal in the acidification of local waterways.
Sample questions: How effective has Ontario’s Drive Clean program been in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the province? What are some industrial and geographic factors that might make air quality in some communities very different from that in others?

By the end of this course, students will:

B1.1 analyse technological applications related to enzyme activity in the food and pharmaceutical industries (e.g., the production of dairy products; breadmaking; the use of enzymes to control reaction rates in pharmaceuticals) [AI, C]
Sample issue: Natural enzymes are used in many food production processes to speed up chemical reactions, which reduces water usage and energy consumption. Scientists are now designing and producing synthetic enzymes that will be more efficient catalysts and allow new technological applications in medicine and industry.
Sample questions: Why are there so many different varieties of cheese when the production process is basically the same for all cheeses?

C. Metabolic Processes (Unit 2)

C1. Relating Science to Technology, Society, and the Environment
By the end of this course, students will:

c1.1 analyse the role of metabolic processes in the functioning of and interactions between biotic and abiotic systems (e.g., specialized microbes and enzymes in biotechnological applications to treat wastewater in the pulp and paper industry; microbes and enzymes in bioremediation, such as in the cleanup of oil spills; energy transfer from producers to consumers) [AI, C]
Sample issue: Most restaurants dispose of cooking oil and grease in an environmentally sound way to avoid contaminating municipal sewer systems. One method they can use is bioaugmentation, which uses microorganisms to
metabolize oils into bacterial biomass, carbon dioxide, and water. However, this process can create unpleasant odours, which are undesirable in a food service setting.
Sample questions: How do symbiotic bacteria use metabolic processes to produce biohydrogen from food waste? How are microbes used in the bioremediation of contaminated groundwater sites? What is the relationship between the position of a particular species in the food chain and the energy required to maintain that species?
c1.2 assess the relevance, to their personal lives and to the community, of an understanding of cell biology and related technologies (e.g., knowledge of metabolic processes is relevant to personal choices about exercise, diet, and the use of pharmacological substances; knowledge of cellular processes aids in our understanding and treatment of mitochondrial diseases [a group of neuromuscular diseases]) [AI, C]
Sample issue: Some fad weight-loss diets include pills that are believed to speed up the body’s metabolism to help a person lose weight quickly. Other diets rely on very low calorie intake for rapid weight loss. However, such
methods can lead to destructive metabolic processes in the body, causing organ failure.
Sample questions: How does stem-cell research related to degenerative diseases use technologies to change the metabolic processes of the cells?

Sample issue: Corporations that have patented genetically modified (GM) seeds legally require farmers to buy new seeds from them each planting season. Corporations that find GM crops on a farm that did not purchase their seed can take the farmer to court. However, natural processes such as cross-pollination can result in the migration of GM crops to neighbouring farms.
Sample questions: Should private companies be able to patent life forms, including genetic material? Why or why not? Who owns and controls our personal genetic information? Who should have access to our personal genetic information
and decide how it will be used? What are the ethical implications of reproductive technologies that allow postmenopausal women to conceive?
d1.2 analyse, on the basis of research, some key aspects of Canadian regulations pertaining to biotechnology (e.g., current or potential legislation for mandatory DNA fingerprinting, human cloning, ownership of a genome, patenting of genetically modified organisms), and compare them to regulations from another jurisdiction [IP, PR, AI, C]
Sample issue: Modern biotechnologies, such as selective breeding, are regulated under Health Canada’s Food and Drugs Act and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. It is an ongoing challenge to ensure that our regulations keep
up with advances in scientific knowledge and technologies, as well as with developments in other countries.
Sample questions: What is the role of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency with respect to biotechnology? What role does the Canadian Environmental Protection Act play in regulating biotechnology? Why was bovine growth hormone
approved for use in dairy cattle in the United States but not in Canada? Why does Mexico have laws to limit the cultivation of genetically modified corn? What countries have banned human cloning? What is Canada’s position on
this issue?

acids; the effects on the human body of substances that people use to cope with stress)
[PR, AI, C]
Sample issue: Steroids are a class of drugs that can be used for healing and building of tissues under proper medical supervision. However, if used for the wrong purpose, such as athletic performance enhancement, or if they are taken
incorrectly, steroids can be dangerous and result in negative long-term effects on many body systems.
Sample questions: How do certain classes of drugs help with neurotransmission in the brain? What effects does aloe vera have on the human body? How do common antidepressants work? Why should people, especially young people, be carefully monitored when on such medications? What are the possible side effects of statin drugs used to lower cholesterol? Why has the federal government proposed legislation to regulate natural health products?
e1.2 evaluate, on the basis of research, some of the human health issues that arise from the impact of human activities on the environment (e.g., the effects of synthetic estrogen compounds released into our water systems; the effects of
leaching of compounds from plastic products into soil and water) [IP, PR, AI, C]
Sample issue: Human-produced biosolids are a low-cost source of nutrient-rich organic matter that is often spread on agricultural land rather than being sent for incineration or landfill disposal. Opponents of land application of biosolids are concerned about the potential health impact of heavy metals, bacteria, and drugs that may remain in the biosolids.
Sample questions: In what ways have mining, forestry, and hydroelectric developments affected the health of Aboriginal people in Northern Ontario? What are the links between air pollution and respiratory diseases such as asthma?
What types of human activity have led to the thinning of the ozone? What human health conditions are related to this phenomenon? How can the dumping of chemicals down sinks and into storm sewers affect the incidence of skin conditions among swimmers at local beaches?

e3.3 describe the homeostatic processes involved in maintaining water, ionic, thermal, and acid–base equilibrium, and explain how these processes help body systems respond to both a change in environment and the effects of medical treatments (e.g., the role of feedback mechanisms in water balance or thermoregulation; how the buffering system of blood maintains the body’s pH balance; the effect of medical treatments on the endocrine system; the effects of chemotherapy on homeostasis)

F. Population Dynamics (Unit 5)

F1. Relating Science to Technology, Society, and the Environment

Sample issue: Every day, millions of Canadians drive their vehicles to work, school, or entertainment venues, which creates greenhouse gases and consumes non-renewable resources. These behaviours, and many other consumption habits, all contribute to our ecological footprint. Many experts believe that we are consuming more resources each year than Earth can produce.
Sample questions: How does the Living Planet Index (LPI) help a nation to assess its ecological footprint and sustain its population? How does the planned obsolescence of electronic devices and appliances contribute to our ecological footprint? What impact has rapid population growth into the suburbs had on the local environment? What is the environmental impact of using packaged infant formula instead of breastfeeding a baby for the first six months of life?
f1.2 assess, on the basis of research, the effectiveness of some Canadian technologies and projects intended to nourish expanding populations (e.g., the risks and benefits of growing genetically modified canola; some of the sustainable development projects funded by the Canadian International Development Agency [CIDA]) [IP, PR, AI, C]
Sample issue: Every year, millions of children in developing nations die from diseases and malnutrition related to micronutrient deficiencies. The Canada-based Micronutrient Initiative develops, implements, and monitors programs aimed at eliminating vitamin and mineral deficiencies in expanding populations. The main challenge of such an initiative is to create sustainable solutions that will reach all those who need help.
Sample questions: How are Canadian programs helping to reverse the effects of land degradation and promote sustainable farming in semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas? What is Canada’s role in the Flour Fortification Initiative, and how effectively does this initiative meet its goal of nourishing expanding populations?

Sample issue: The cooling of homes and commercial buildings in summer requires more energy than heating in the winter at peak times. Brownouts are more likely in summer than in winter. However, new technologies use deep lake water cooling as an alternative to conventional air conditioning systems in office towers. This significantly reduces energy use and its environmental impact.
Sample questions: What proportion of Ontario’s energy needs is served by solar and wind technologies? What are the pros and cons of expanding the availability of these technologies? What types of chemical reactions occur in different types of fuel cells? What are the advantages and disadvantages, in terms of efficiency and environmental impact, of using

Sample issue: Bleaches such as hydrogen peroxide and chlorine are used when fibres are processed into paper or textiles. Concentrations of these substances can harm the environment, but if enzymes are added to these processes as biocatalysts, fewer chemicals are needed, less energy is consumed, and there is less environmental impact.
Sample questions: How can you increase the rate of decomposition in a home composter? What can be done to improve the efficiency of an automobile that runs entirely on fossil fuels? Why is just a very small quantity of catalyst required in industrial processes? Why is the ozone layer still deteriorating despite the banning of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)?

d3.4 state Hess’s law, and explain, using examples, how it is applied to find the enthalpy changes of a reaction
d3.5 explain, using collision theory and potential energy diagrams, how factors such as temperature, the surface area of the reactants, the nature of the reactants, the addition of catalysts, and the concentration of the solution control the rate of a chemical reaction
d3.6 describe simple potential energy diagrams of chemical reactions (e.g., the relationships between the relative energies of reactants and products and the activation energy of the reaction)

e1.1 analyse the optimal conditions for a specific chemical process related to the principles of equilibrium that takes place in nature or is used in industry (e.g., the production of sulfuric acid, electrolyte balance in the human body, sedimentation in water systems) [AI, C]
Sample issue: The principle of dynamic equilibrium is used in industrial processes to maximize the concentration of products and minimize leftover reactants. Industrial chemists determine ideal pressure and temperature conditions, and proper catalysts, so that fewer materials and less energy are used.
Sample questions: Why are low temperature conditions not used with exothermic reactions? How do chemicals dissolved in human blood help maintain a blood pH level between 7.2 and 7.4?

Sample issue: Hydrogen fuel cells use hydrogen as the fuel and oxygen as the oxidant, and produce water, rather than environmentally harmful greenhouse gases, as waste. Although some cars run on such cells, practical problems must be resolved before this source of energy is commonly used in the transportation sector.
